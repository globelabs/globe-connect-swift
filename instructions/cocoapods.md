#### Installation

If you're going to install the Swift package via Cocoapods, make sure that your project is a
XCode Project.

Once you have a newly created or existing XCode project, fire up your terminal and `cd` to your
project directory then type `pod init` to setup a `Podfile` in your project directory.

Open up your browser and go to [Cocoapods page of the SDK](https://cocoapods.org/pods/GlobeConnectSwift)
and look up for the installation guide.
